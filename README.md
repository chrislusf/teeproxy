Quixey/Teeproxy
===============
Forked repo for use in quixey/quixey-gor (to replace burger/gor) to allow Quixey Ops to replicate traffic for testing purposes.
This repo is forked so we may correct the proxied response which the orriginal script returns, to make teeproxy.go sufficient to our needs of replicating RESTFul API Traffic.

teeproxy
=========

A reverse HTTP proxy that duplicates requests.

Why you may need this?
----------------------
You may have production servers running, but you need to upgrade to a new system. You want to run A/B test on both old and new systems to confirm the new system can handle the production load, and want to see whether the new system can run in shadow mode continuously without any issue.

How it works?
-------------
teeproxy is a reverse HTTP proxy. For each incoming request, it clone the request into 2 requests, forward them to 2 servers. The results from server a are returned as usual, but the results from server b are ignored.

teeproxy handles GET, POST, and all other http methods.

Build
-------------
go build

Usage
-------------
 ./teeproxy -l :8888 -a localhost:9000 -b localhost:9001

 "-l" specifies the listening port. "-a" and "-b" are meant for system A and B. The B system can be taken down or started up without causing any issue to the teeproxy.

#### Configuring timeouts ####
It's also possible to configure the timeout to both systems
*  -a.timeout int: timeout in seconds for production traffic (default 3)
*  -b.timeout int: timeout in seconds for alternate site traffic (default 1)
